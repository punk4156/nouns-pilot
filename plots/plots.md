EXT. OUTSIDE WOODS TWILIGHT

There are places you that don't quite make sense as the world around you spins in different directions. These places are present at different times and change the nature of the life around it.

On this one day, it happened with #1. A long hunter is in the woods at twilight as the world spins off kilter just so, his prize hunt the fox is still running.

As he is running a cloud like substance appears in front of him, like a horrid version of a my little pony episode filled with sparkles a purple. The fox jumps right at the time the hunter gets there merging into the cloud like a poorly done science experiment.

The noun accession has started. Through the portal to the nounverse the fox and the hunter combine into one creating the unification process needed to enter the world unknoun. The could disappears and we enter the nounverse.
